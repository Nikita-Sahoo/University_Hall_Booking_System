# University_Hall_Booking_System
The University Hall Booking System project aims to develop an efficient and user-friendly platform for managing the booking of university halls. This system addresses the challenges of traditional manual booking processes, such as scheduling conflicts and lack of transparency, by providing a centralized solution. 

Key Responsibilities & Achievements:

*  Designed and implemented a role-based system supporting Admin, Dean, Hod and Faculty logins with different access privileges.

* Developed an interactive booking interface allowing users to view hall availability, select date/time slots, and submit booking requests.

* Integrated email notification system for approval status updates and booking confirmations.

* Implemented conflict detection logic to prevent double-bookings and handle overlapping requests.

* Managed database design using MySQL to store hall information, booking records, user profiles, and request logs efficiently.

* Created admin dashboard for adding new record, managing halls and generating booking reports.

* Built a user-friendly frontend using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for responsive and intuitive navigation.

* Ensured form validation, authentication, and session management for secure user access and data integrity.
